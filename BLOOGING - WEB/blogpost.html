            <h1>PW IOI</h1>
           <h4> By- Pranjal Shukla </h4>

            <p>PW IOI utilizes JEE Main and Advanced scores for shortlisting students for the undergraduate program. Students eligible for JEE advanced gets a direct admission in the programme. In the case of students who haven’t registered for JEE Advanced, students will have to clear the admission test. Our counselor team will call you to guide you through the registration process.</p><br><br>
              <p>  According to PW Skills, close to 85-86 percent of students are coming from the small towns of India.
                “Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh — these are the states from where we are getting lots and lots of enrollment,” stated Kumar.
                PW Skills also offers placement assistance through its exclusive job portal. The platform has partnerships with over 250 companies, including Tata IQ, Siemens, Leadsquared, SAP, Oracle, KPMG, and Amazon to offer top-notch job opportunities to learners.
                “In the last three years, we have placed approximately 10,000+ students in product-based companies, MNCs and well-funded startups. We are planning to host a big job fair for PW Skills students very soon,” said Kumar.
                PW Skills currently offers hybrid courses in data science, Java, C++, full-stack web development, and other tech courses at disruptive pricing for Rs 3,500 onwards. The company is looking to explore blockchain, cybersecurity, and AR/VR-focused courses to strengthen India's talent pipeline. The firm aims to have 10 lahks skilled tech workforce within the next three years.</p>
                <p><br><br>
                “We will try to expand this entire skill domain maybe into some non-technical courses. A huge set of people staying in Tier 2-3 cities, would like to get into non-tech courses like additional marketing, MBA or finance-related courses,” added Kumar.
                PhysicsWallah’s FY23 revenue has jumped three-fold to Rs 780 crore as compared to Rs 233 crore in FY22. It expects its revenue to grow over 10-fold to Rs 2,500 crore in FY24 driven by expansion of business.
                “For the PW Skills, we are planning to clock $10 million in ARR this year,” added Kumar.
                The Westbridge Capital-backed edtech unicorn acquired iNeuron Intelligence last year for Rs 250 crore to expand its offerings in the upskilling category. PW Skills also recently partnered with NSDC to make skilling, reskilling and upskilling affordable for learners. The company, however, has no plans for any acquisitions as of now.
                Going forward, PW Skills plans to expand into joint certification courses with top colleges, diploma courses, and technology courses in vernacular languages. The training programs cater to learners of all levels, from fundamentals to advanced, ensuring accessibility and ease of understanding.
